# Rust Server port

[Server #325](https://github.com/durable-workflow/server/issues/325) owns the
rewrite and its acceptance evidence. PHP remains the default published runtime.
The unpublished Rust crate has an Avro foundation; no Rust HTTP runtime,
migration, performance improvement or cutover is qualified yet.

## Work order and current status

1. Inventory the current contract, schema and operational surfaces. Establish
   shared reviewed fixtures and a recorder usable against any isolated Server
   URL and a real embedded Laravel engine. Freeze published PHP/consumer artifacts
   and measure PHP before implementing Rust.
2. Add a Rust runtime in this repository through small vertical slices. Run the
   differential fixtures for each change and settle disagreements against the
   published contract before changing either implementation.
3. Complete the capability inventory, published SDK and consumer directions,
   three-database conformance, multi-node interruption and performance gates.
4. Qualify backup-first sequential takeover, interrupted migrations, PHP refusal
   of upgraded databases, operator procedures and the major-release decision.
5. Publish exact artifacts through the existing release process and verify
   downstream consumers. Cloud adoption belongs to its separate owner.

The first slice covers only Avro echo (including an exact large int64) and one external activity, completed by
the published PHP SDK and the embedded engine. Its fixtures require exact event
order, stable public workflow identity, retained run/operation relationships,
decoded input/result values and one committed completion. Passing these cases
does not prove the remaining acceptance criteria.

Ordinary PHP, Rust and embedded runs use independent databases. Never connect
different engines to one database concurrently. SQLite multi-node qualification
must state its shared-file topology and locking limits; existing single-node
support is not evidence of multi-node safety.

## Decisions

- Shared fixtures are expectations reviewed against public contracts, not PHP
  recordings promoted to expected behavior. The recorder keeps raw observations;
  the comparator checks the declared fixture projection. Coverage is explicit.
- The HTTP adapter uses the published PHP SDK and its official Avro codec. The
  embedded adapter executes real Workflow jobs and persisted history. Neither
  counts an accepted start as completion or substitutes mocked execution.
- Generated run/activity/attempt identifiers may differ between independent
  databases. Compare their relationships with bijective aliases; retain actual
  IDs in raw evidence. Preserve workflow IDs, event order, command sequences,
  attempt counts and decoded values. Wall-clock observations remain raw.
- The first Rust foundation uses Apache's official Avro single-object
  reader/writer with the immutable schema. HTTP/storage architecture remains
  pending. Avoid unnecessary dependencies and code generation. Record
  clean and incremental compile time plus target-directory size for the first
  runtime slice. Use one task-owned Cargo target directory, low debug information
  for development, bounded build concurrency and cleanup after qualification.
- Evaluate [Kache](https://github.com/kunobi-ninja/kache) in a task-local runtime
  before choosing the Rust build setup. Use an explicit cache budget and local
  storage; measure physical disk blocks across cache and targets together. Keep
  cache and build outputs under one container mount so cross-mount copying does
  not erase sharing. Use a per-run compiler wrapper and scoped cleanup.
  The [first real crate measurements](../rust/build-observations-2026-10-09.md)
  observed native clean builds around 22 seconds and 182 MiB targets. Kache
  restored a fresh target in 3.5 seconds but added cold-build time and retained
  disk; native no-op/comment-edit builds were faster in-place. Keep it optional.
  Full-server build cost and any disk-saving claim remain pending.
- Tokio tasks are [cooperatively scheduled](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/task/coop/index.html).
  Potentially expensive replay, decoding and synchronous database operations
  need bounded work away from the async request executor. `spawn_blocking` needs
  an explicit CPU concurrency limit, and a started blocking job cannot be
  aborted. Preserve durable fencing and cancellation checks around that work;
  qualify timer, lease and cancellation deadlines under CPU-heavy load.

## Evidence and next action

The initial source and published artifact tuple is in
[`../tests/Fixtures/ServerParity/php-baseline.json`](../tests/Fixtures/ServerParity/php-baseline.json).
It freezes inputs, not a passing performance result. Fixture and runner commits,
hardware, resource limits and actual measurement commands belong in each retained
result. Do not compare performance across concurrent unrelated host workloads.

The first HTTP and embedded recordings passed on the frozen amd64 image and
Workflow package, with an independent SQLite database for each. Hosted
[fixture execution](https://github.com/durable-workflow/server/actions/runs/37889894631)
retains both raw records and the comparison for 90 days. It executes both
workflows to completion, including the activity, with the published PHP SDK.
[PR #326](https://github.com/durable-workflow/server/pull/326) owns source checks
and review. The linked final run covers all three cases, including the large
int64 and explicit decoded type trees.
This is bounded correctness evidence, not performance qualification
or a three-database/three-runtime pass.

The fixture foundation is merged in #326. All three cases and 25 comparator
checks passed at its exact head, together with the full PHP feature suite.

The [development reference profile](../benchmarks/server-port/v1/README.md)
pins the current PHP/SDK tuple and uses existing standard-workflow and mixed
idle-poll commands. Its preparation is merged in [#327](https://github.com/durable-workflow/server/pull/327).
The [diagnostic observations](../benchmarks/server-port/v1/php-observations-2026-10-09.md)
are complete: three repetitions at 0.25 and 0.5 offered starts/s completed all
workflows in-window; at 1/s, only 48–51 of 120 completed in-window before the
remainder drained. The high-rate retry had one readiness 503, and the original
second run's configured hourly worker exit invalidated its resource comparison.
All outcomes and failures are retained. Following drift windows passed; sampling
gaps, missing complete client resource costs and changed background load still
prevent a PHP/Rust improvement claim. The development host's kernel,
runtime and SATA storage differ from the standard capacity topology, so that
profile preserves the full capacity gate and makes no maximum-capacity claim.

Mixed idle observations completed three repetitions each at 6, 12 and 24 polls.
Six polls returned six empty outcomes; twelve returned eight empty outcomes and
four explicit capacity rejections; twenty-four returned eight empty outcomes and
sixteen rejections. All registrations were removed, with no claimed tasks,
runtime restart or OOM. Query waits were clamped to about five seconds, while
workflow/activity waits lasted about ten seconds. Health/readiness probes passed
throughout the six- and twelve-poll runs. All three twenty-four-poll registration
bursts caused at least one two-second API probe timeout, with an Apache
`MaxRequestWorkers` warning observed. These failures remain part of the reference
evidence; API headroom at that burst size is not qualified. Shared-host background
work changed between measurements, so a PHP/Rust performance gain still requires
matched conditions and drift controls.

The unpublished [Rust foundation](../rust/README.md) in
[#329](https://github.com/durable-workflow/server/pull/329) implements the Value
adapter and complete-frame check, retaining exact int64, bytes/text, array/map
and finite-double distinctions. Its first tests exposed Apache's streaming EOF
null sentinel; the frame adapter now rejects incomplete datums. Fifteen reviewed
logical values passed local Rust/PHP cross-decoding in both directions, including
the existing golden long-zero wire. These are codec checks, not execution of a
durable workflow on Rust. Malformed collection blocks, duplicate keys, resource
limits and external payload ingress remain explicit gates before HTTP integration.

Next: qualify the exact source head in CI and measure clean/incremental compile
time and physical build/cache disk use. Then add the first HTTP/database execution
slice against the existing shared workflow fixtures. Expand fixtures
using the existing conformance inventory. The rest
of the inventory remains open under #325. No separate defect issues have been
filed yet.
